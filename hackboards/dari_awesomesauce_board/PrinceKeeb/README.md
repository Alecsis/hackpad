## Obligatory Yapping
I decided to make a hackboard because I wanted to challenge myself. Plus, mechanical keyboards seem really cool.
One thing that I learned the most from this project is the importance of reading documentation and researching. Looking up pinouts, watching youtube videos, googling, etc, was what allowed me to figure out how to put everything together, despite my only experience with this kind of stuff being my hackpad
