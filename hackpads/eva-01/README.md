# EVA-01

## Overview

I'm Joseph, and this is my Macropad! The EVA-01. It features 14 inputs, has 12 switches, one knob, and an OLED display! I will be using this for coding and cad work! I know this pcb is over the limit; however, I can pay for the board myself, I love this layout and wouldn't want to see it go away!

I would like to solder it myself!
## About 

I've looked at the apollo keyboard, one that I have which is eva themed, and wanted to create a replica of it. I love everything EVA related and this project was so fun to do, it just took 12 years to finish the case LOL.
